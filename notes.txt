The purpose of the new implementation

Besides other cleaning up, a purpose of this new implementation to make it really have V-detector's applicability to
data type other than real-valued vectors.

The point, or data item, only needs to have a 'comparable' distance between any two points. 
This distance still should have triangle property:
	d(A,B)+d(B,C)>d(A,C)
However, to make the definition of distance more generic, 
(1) the operation of subtraction is not required, so the point-wise is not supported
(2) the operation of addition is not required, so the constant size is not supported
Those changes limit the variety of V-detector, but bring out the more important strength of V-detector. 
Constant size is especially not necessary to keep because it was introduced for comparison in the first place.
